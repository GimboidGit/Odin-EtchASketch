## Overview
Relive your childhood with this online Etch-A-Sketch!

Set the grid size to something denser if desired and enjoy.


<br>


## Planned Updates
~~Add Confirmation of "Shake" (reset):~~
- ~~To aid in preventing any accidental resets.~~

~~Ability to Save drawings:~~
- ~~User friendly version that will "snapshot" the webpage.~~

~~Two Additional Colour Modes:~~
- ~~Random RGB colouring of squares.~~
- ~~Gradual black colouration (Gradient).~~


<br>

Add animation to reset button:
- Idea is that the Etch-A-Sketch will "move" left-to-right a few times, then the canvas will be cleared.

Additional colour modes:
- Simple, single colour picker for RGB range

Keyboard Control Scheme:
- Emulate the acutal Etch-A-Sketch use of two "wheels"; one for verical movement, one for horizontal movement.
